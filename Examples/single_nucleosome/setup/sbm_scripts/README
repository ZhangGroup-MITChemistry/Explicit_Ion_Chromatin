1) Need to create a new bond_list potential to have individual constraints
2) For angle, we could just use the same list from angle_list.cpp
3) For dihedral, we better create a new potential.
4) For pair, we just add a new potential to the pair_list file.

right now, r12 exclusion is implemented with a full matrix. should convert it to a sparse matrix to save memory.
