The USER-3SPN2 package was updated on 12/23/13 to fix bugs that occasionally resulted in simulations to explode/crash.

1)  The use of the minimum image convention was accidentally omitted for the distances calculated in basepair.cpp.
This would occasionally lead to large forces between base sites that crossed back-and-forth across periodic boundaries.
The code was modified to use the existing minimum image convention in domain.cpp

2)  Simulations would occasionally produce NaNs when cphi[i] was very close to -1 or 1.  
This would result in division by 0.   A typo was corrected and a missing line was added to prevent this error.

3)  The number of total sites is hard-coded in pair_3spn.2.
It has been changed from 14 to 30 to permit additional sites when using pair_style hybrid or hybrid/overlay with leading to segmentation faults.

4)  Lastly, the spheres.vmd file was added to sample_in/ to represent the DNA molecules as it was represented in the 3SPN.2 manuscript.
