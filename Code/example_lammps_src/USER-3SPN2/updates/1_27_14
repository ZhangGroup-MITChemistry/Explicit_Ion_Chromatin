The USER-3SPN2 package was updated on 1/27/14 to fix issues that occasionally resulted in segfaults.
The changes are as follows:

1) The hard-coded numbers of sites in pair_3spn2.cpp was changed from n=14 to n=40, thus allowing the simulation 
of DNA with other site types (tethers, nanoparticles or proteins).  The choice of 40 is arbitrary.

2) Checks were added basepair.cpp to prevent segmentation faults that occur when simulating large systems across many 
processors.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Dan Hinckley (dhinckley@wisc.edu).
