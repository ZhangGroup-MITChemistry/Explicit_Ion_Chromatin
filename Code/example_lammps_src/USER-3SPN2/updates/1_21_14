The USER-3SPN2 was updated on 1/12/14 to account for a typo in the spreadsheet used to obtain
the CG coordinates of the C site.

DSIM_ICNF/wrte_lammps.c and pair_3spn2.cpp were changed reflect these changes.

This does not change the results of the previous version of the model, as the forcefield and
topology were always self-consistent.
