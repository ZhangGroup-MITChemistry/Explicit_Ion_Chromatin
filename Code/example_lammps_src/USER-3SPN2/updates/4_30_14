USER-3SPN2 has been updated to permit the simulation of B-DNA with intrinsic
curvature.  Additionally, examples files have been added to demonstrate
simulations with explicit ions and an (experimental) model for A-DNA.  The
syntax of pair_style 3spn2 has been changed in order to accomodate these
different styles of DNA.  Please refer to the Documentation for details.
