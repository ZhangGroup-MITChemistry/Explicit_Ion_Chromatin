pair_style 3spn2 command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style 3spn2 T salt Rc

T = temperature (Kelvin) 
salt = ionic strenth (mM)
Rc = short range cutoff used for all non-bonded interactions except for electrostatics :ul

[Examples:] 

pair_style 3spn2 300.0 100.0 18.0
pair_coeff 0.239 5.9 :ul

[Description:]

Style {3spn2} computes interactions based on the non-bonded potentials from
"(Hinckley)"_#Hinckley for the simulation of coarse-grained DNA.  Style {3spn2}
includes all non-bonded components from "(Hinckley)"_#Hinckley besides base
stacking which is currently implemented in "angle_3spn2_stacking"_angle_3spn2_stacking.html.

This pair style is not a true pair style, as it calcules angle-dependent
potentials that are functions of the positions of up to 6 atoms.
The contributions to the non-bonded energy function shown above are as follows.

The excluded volume energy is

:c,image(./pair_3spn2_exe.jpg)

where epsilon and sigma are obtained using arithmetic mixing rules with the
values provided with the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command.

The base pairing and cross stacking energies are 

:c,image(./pair_3spn2_bp.jpg)

and 

:c,image(./pair_3spn2_cstk.jpg)

with the values of the epsilon's, alpha's, and K's being specific to the type of each atom and hard-coded into pair_3spn.cpp.

As in "angle_3spn2_stacking"_angle_3spn2_stacking.html the Morse potential Em is decomposed into repulsive

:c,image(./3spn2_morse_rep.jpg)

and attractive components

:c,image(./3spn2_morse_attr.jpg).

The attractive portion of the potential is modulated by the function f

:c,image(./3spn2_f.jpg)

which uses the difference between the instantenous angle and reference angle
(Delta theta = theta - theta_o) and a factor K. The differences in angle shown
above (Delta theta\[1-3\] and Delta phi) refer to deviations from reference
angles extracted from the crystal structure of B-DNA.
Each epsilon is unique to the identity of the atoms involved, as is the
equilibrium difference r0. These values are hard-coded into the pair style.
The user is referred to "(Hinckley)"_#Hinckley for additional details on how
these parameters are assigned.

Lastly, electrostatic interactions are calculated at the level of Debye-Huckel, as in pair style {coul/debye} as described in "pair_coul"_pair_coul.html.

:c,image(./pair_3spn2_coul.jpg)

This potential has the same form as pair style {coul/debye} and includes C as
the energy-conversion constant, the inverse Debye length Kappa and the charges
Qi and Qj.  
Noticeable differences include the temperature and ionic strength-dependent
dielectric constant and.  See "(Hinckley)"_#Hinckley for the functional dependence
on these variables.  Because the  dielectric constant is calculated with the
pair style,  using the "dielectric"_dielectric.html command will have no
effect.  

The "compute_pair"_compute_pair.html command should be used to calculate the
energy of the different contributions to the pair style.
The calculated quantities are returned as a vector, organized as follows: \[Ebp
Ecstk Eexe Ecoul Nbp\].  The last value is the number of base pairs being
formed.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands.

epsilon (energy)
sigma (length) :ul

These units are used in the calculation of excluded volume interactions.  Other
parameters used in the non-bonded interactions are hard-coded
into the {3spn2} pair style source code.

NOTE: It is not recommended that the short-range cutoff be changed.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, arithmetic mixing rules MUST be used.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift, table and tail options.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

:line

[Restrictions:] 

This pair style is part of the USER-3SPN2 package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was build with that package.  See the "Making_LAMMPS"_Making_LAMMPS.html
section for more info.

The hard-coded values of the reference distances Ro and epsilon are currently
in Angstroms and kcal/mol, respectively.   In addition, tthe temperature and ionic strength specified as "pair_style"_pair_style.html
arguments are to be specified in Kelvin and milliMolar (mM).  Therefore, real "units"_units.html
should be used.

[Default:] none
