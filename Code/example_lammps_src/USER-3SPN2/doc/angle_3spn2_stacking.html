<P>which uses the difference between the instantenous angle and reference angle
(Delta theta = theta - theta_o) and a factor K.  Technically, this energy
function represents a non-bonded interaction; however, it is currently
implemented as an "angle" because it acts between 3 well-defined sites.
The user is referred to <A HREF = "#Hinckley">(Hinckley)</A> for additional details.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
<A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A> command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands:

<UL><LI>epsilon (energy)
<LI>r0 (angstroms) 
<LI>theta0 (degrees)
<LI>alpha (unitless)
<LI>K (unitless) 
</UL>
<P>NOTE: When using this angle style in a simulations of coarse-grained DNA, it is
used together with the <A HREF = "angle_hybrid.html">angle_hybrid</A> command.  
As noted in the documentation, the angle coefficients for hybrid angle styles are
not stored in the restart file.  Therefore, they must be restated in the LAMMPS
input file when restarting.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none

<P>This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-3SPN2 package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
