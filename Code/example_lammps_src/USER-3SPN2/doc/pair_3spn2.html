<H3>pair_style 3spn2 command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>pair_style 3spn2 T salt Rc
</P>
<UL><LI>T = temperature (Kelvin) 
<LI>salt = ionic strenth (mM)
<LI>Rc = short range cutoff used for all non-bonded interactions except for electrostatics

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Style <I>3spn2</I> computes interactions based on the non-bonded potentials from
<A HREF = "#Hinckley">(Hinckley)</A> for the simulation of coarse-grained DNA.  Style <I>3spn2</I>
includes all non-bonded components from <A HREF = "#Hinckley">(Hinckley)</A> besides base
stacking which is currently implemented in <A HREF = "angle_3spn2_stacking.html">angle_3spn2_stacking</A>.  
</P>

<P>This pair style is not a true pair style, as it calcules angle-dependent
potentials that are functions of the positions of up to 6 atoms.
The contributions to the non-bonded energy function shown above are as follows.

<P>The excluded volume energy is

<P>where epsilon and sigma are obtained using arithmetic mixing rules with the
values provided with the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command.

<P>The base pairing and cross stacking energies are

<P>with the values of the epsilon's, alpha's, and K's being specific to the type of each atom and hard-coded into pair_3spn.cpp.
</P>
<P>As in <A HREF = "angle_3spn2_stacking.html">angle_3spn2_stacking</A> the Morse potential Em is decomposed into repulsive

<P>which uses the difference between the instantenous angle and reference angle
(Delta theta = theta - theta_o) and a factor K. The differences in angle shown
above (Delta theta[1-3] and Delta phi) refer to deviations from reference
angles extracted from the crystal structure of B-DNA.
Each epsilon is unique to the identity of the atoms involved, as is the
equilibrium difference r0. These values are hard-coded into the pair style.
The user is referred to <A HREF = "#Hinckley">(Hinckley)</A> for additional details on how
these parameters are assigned.
</P>
<P>Lastly, electrostatic interactions are calculated at the level of Debye-Huckel, as in pair style <I>coul/debye</I> as described in <A HREF = "pair_coul.html">pair_coul</A>.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "./pair_3spn2_coul.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>This potential has the same form as pair style <I>coul/debye</I> and includes C as
the energy-conversion constant, the inverse Debye length Kappa and the charges
Qi and Qj.  
Noticeable differences include the temperature and ionic strength-dependent
dielectric constant and.  See <A HREF = "#Hinckley">(Hinckley)</A> for the functional dependence
on these variables.  Because the  dielectric constant is calculated with the
pair style,  using the <A HREF = "dielectric.html">dielectric</A> command will have no
effect.  
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "compute_pair.html">compute_pair</A> command should be used to calculate the
energy of the different contributions to the pair style.
The calculated quantities are returned as a vector, organized as follows: [Ebp
Ecstk Eexe Ecoul Nbp].  The last value is the number of base pairs being
formed.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands.

<UL><LI>epsilon (energy)
<LI>sigma (length) 
</UL>
<P>These units are used in the calculation of excluded volume interactions.  Other
parameters used in the non-bonded interactions are hard-coded
into the <I>3spn2</I> pair style source code.
</P>
<P>NOTE: It is not recommended that the short-range cutoff be changed.

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, arithmetic mixing rules MUST be used.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> shift, table and tail options.
</P>
<P>This pair style writes its information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>This pair style can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  It does not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B> 
</P>
<P>This pair style is part of the USER-3SPN2 package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was build with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Making_LAMMPS.html">Making_LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
</P>
<P>The hard-coded values of the reference distances Ro and epsilon are currently
in Angstroms and kcal/mol, respectively.   In addition, tthe temperature and ionic strength specified as <A HREF = "pair_style.html">pair_style</A>
arguments are to be specified in Kelvin and milliMolar (mM).  Therefore, real <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
should be used.
