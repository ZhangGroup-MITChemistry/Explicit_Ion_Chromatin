dihedral_style 3spn2 command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style 3spn2 :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style 3spn2
dihedral_coeff 1  1.434    -359.17 0.30 :ul

[Description:]

The {3spn2} dihedral style uses the potential

:c,image(./dihedral_3spn2.jpg)

and was originally implemented for inclusion in the 3SPN.2 coarse-grained DNA model of "(Hinckley)"_#Hinckley .

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above,
or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands.

K (energy)
phi0 (degrees)
sigma (degrees) :ul

:line

[Restrictions:]

This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-3SPN2 package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info on packages.

[Default:] none
