angle_style 3spn2_stacking command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style 3spn2_stacking :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style 3spn2_stacking
angle_coeff 11  3.439293    3.716    101.15  3.    6. :ul

[Description:]

The {3spn2_stacking} angle style uses the potential

:c,image(./angle_3spn2_stacking.jpg)

with the Morse potential Em decomposed into repulsive

:c,image(./3spn2_morse_rep.jpg)

and attractive components

:c,image(./3spn2_morse_attr.jpg).

The attractive portion of the potential is modulated by the function f

:c,image(./3spn2_f.jpg)

which uses the difference between the instantenous angle and reference angle
(Delta theta = theta - theta_o) and a factor K.  Technically, this energy
function represents a non-bonded interaction; however, it is currently
implemented as an "angle" because it acts between 3 well-defined sites.
The user is referred to "(Hinckley)"_#Hinckley for additional details.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

epsilon (energy)
r0 (angstroms) 
theta0 (degrees)
alpha (unitless)
K (unitless) :ul

NOTE: When using this angle style in a simulations of coarse-grained DNA, it is
used together with the "angle_hybrid"_angle_hybrid.html command.  
As noted in the documentation, the angle coefficients for hybrid angle styles are
not stored in the restart file.  Therefore, they must be restated in the LAMMPS
input file when restarting.

[Restrictions:] none

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-3SPN2 package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.
