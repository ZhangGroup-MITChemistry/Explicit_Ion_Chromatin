This directory contains input files and other collateral relevant to "Coarse
Grained Ions for Nucleic Acid Modeling" by Hinckley and de Pablo (2015;
http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00341).

The contents are as follows:

lammps_in/ - the key contribution of this work; the tabulated effective potentials
and LAMMPS commands need to properly configure the nonbonded Coulombic interactions.
Also contains a .py script that can be used to generate the pair coefficients of
the soft-repulsion that occurs between charged and uncharged sites

splines/ - the knots (params) as calculated from relative entropy coarse-graining,
as well as the linearly interpolated effective potentials.  Also contains a 
gnuplot script that will generate an .eps identical to Figure S7 of the SI.

tools/ - contains a python script that can be used to add ions to a 3SPN.2 configuration,
regardless of whether the configuration already contains ions.  Please note that some
manual adjustment is currently required to have the configuration correctly read by
LAMMPS.  This includes adding the tabulated bond and angle interactions for Spd3+

example/ - a working example of dsDNA simulation with Na+, Mg2+, Spd3+ and Cl-.

Please direct any inquiries to Dan Hinckley (hinckley.dan@gmail.com).  Thanks!
