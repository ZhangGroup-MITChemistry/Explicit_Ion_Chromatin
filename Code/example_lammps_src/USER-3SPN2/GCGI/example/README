LAMMPS configuration files generated with the following commands:

/path/to/icnf.exe seq 0 1 . 0
python ../tools/lmp_add_ions.py conf_lammps.in 50 10 5 conf_lammps_ions.in

Note that I had to manually change conf_lammps.in file to include the tabulated
bond and angle interactions for Spd3+.  Please "diff" conf_lammps_ions.in and 
conf_lammps_ions.in.orig to see what needed to be changed.
